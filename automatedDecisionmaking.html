    <div id="dropdown" class="dropdown-content" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown')">
        <p>An automatic system is programmed to operate without a human 
		providing inputs for each operation.</p>

		<p>There are plans for 165 miles of drone superhighway that will link
		airspace over the Midlands and the south of England. This will enable 
		a range of activities, such as the delivery of vaccines and blood samples
		and support for search and rescue missions, to be carried out using drones
		piloted by computers.</p>
		<p>
		In a separate initiative, a team is developing a system of drones 
		that can carry resuscitation (CPR) equipment and communication technology 
		to heart attack patients. An ambulance will not be required to deliver the 
		CPR equipment. Drones can navigate through available airspace, meaning that
		they will not be caught in traffic jams, and they do not require a human pilot.
		This initiative has the potential to increase the speed and lower the cost 
		of every delivery of CPR equipment. If the same amount of money spent on 
		delivering CPR equipment by ambulance over a year is spent on drone
		deliveries, the number of drone deliveries can potentially increase too.</p>
		<p><u><br>Impact</u></p>
		<p>Through the introduction of remote medical deliveries, the cultural 
		practices of a society's health service can be adapted so that remote
		communities can be better served, health professionals can be redeployed 
		to concentrate on other tasks, access to healthcare can be improved,
		and life expectancy can be increased.</p>
		<p> What ethical considerations arise from the use of CPR equipment drones? 
		Taking a wider view, some are concerned that people who are present in this 
		situation may not be confident with the use of the technology, or may rely
		too heavily on the technology, or the CPR they would otherwise give while 
		waiting for the drone could be interrupted. Therefore, introducing this sort
		of technology could cause harm to some people.</p>
